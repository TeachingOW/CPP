Sure! Let's go deeper into **how precedence and evaluation order work** in `z = y++` with a more detailed breakdown.

---

### **Example with Detailed Output**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int y = 5;
    int z = y++; // Post-increment example

    cout << "After z = y++:" << endl;
    cout << "z = " << z << endl; // Old value of y is assigned to z
    cout << "y = " << y << endl; // y is incremented after assignment

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Expected Output:**
```
After z = y++:
z = 5
y = 6
```

### **Step-by-Step Execution of `z = y++;`**
| Step | Action | `y` Value | `z` Value |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Evaluate `y++` (post-increment) | `5` | (not assigned yet) |
| 2 | `y++` returns the **old value** of `y` (`5`) | `5` | (not assigned yet) |
| 3 | Assign returned value (`5`) to `z` | `5` | `5` |
| 4 | Increment `y` | `6` | `5` |

---

### **Why Doesn't Precedence Affect the Order?**
Even though `++` has **higher precedence** than `=`, the **post-increment operator (`y++`) follows these rules:**
1. It **returns the old value** first.
2. It **increments the variable after returning** the value.
3. The assignment (`=`) receives the **returned value, not the incremented one**.

#### **Operator Precedence Table**
| Operator | Symbol | Precedence | Associativity |
|----------|--------|------------|--------------|
| Post-increment | `y++` | **Higher** | Left to Right |
| Assignment | `=` | **Lower** | Right to Left |

Since `y++` is a **postfix operator**, it is evaluated **before** `=`, but it still returns the **original value** before incrementing.

---

### **Comparison with `z = ++y;`**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int y = 5;
    int z = ++y; // Pre-increment example

    cout << "After z = ++y:" << endl;
    cout << "z = " << z << endl; // New value of y is assigned to z
    cout << "y = " << y << endl; // y is already incremented

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Expected Output:**
```
After z = ++y:
z = 6
y = 6
```

#### **Step-by-Step Execution of `z = ++y;`**
| Step | Action | `y` Value | `z` Value |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| 1 | `++y` increments `y` first | `6` | (not assigned yet) |
| 2 | `++y` returns the **new value** of `y` (`6`) | `6` | (not assigned yet) |
| 3 | Assign returned value (`6`) to `z` | `6` | `6` |

### **Key Takeaways**
âœ… **Operator precedence does not override evaluation order!**  
âœ… **Post-increment (`y++`) returns the old value first, then increments.**  
âœ… **Pre-increment (`++y`) increments first, then returns the new value.**  

Would you like me to visualize this with memory addresses or assembly-like breakdown? ðŸš€
